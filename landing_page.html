<h3>30 November 2018</h3>
<br></br>
<p>Assignments are due today, dont forget! Here is some classic Lorem Ipsum. Nullam malesuada sodales dapibus. Phasellus velit neque, auctor a diam commodo, placerat sodales lacus. Praesent ante quam,
ullamcorper in mi quis, luctus ullamcorper ante. Nunc mollis libero in venenatis aliquet. Donec congue lorem et risus fringilla, id porta lacus lacinia. Fusce id dictum lorem. Nam magna
ex, pellentesque sit amet ultrices quis, ultrices ac felis. Aenean volutpat facilisis quam quis suscipit. Curabitur nec aliquet nunc. Aliquam blandit enim non blandit scelerisque. Praesent eu
 lorem eu sem hendrerit condimentum. Aliquam ornare ultricies purus, sagittis imperdiet nunc dignissim ut.</p>

<p>I once drank a whole gallon of milk in a whole day and I could feel my bones expand. At first I thought I was just full from the milk, but my skin started to form stretch marks and I was visibly wider. I didn't know what was happening but I had an uncontrollable urge to drink more milk. I drove into the nearest gas station and literally ripped the door off the rifrigerated section containing the milk.</p>
<h5>11 November 2018</h5>
<p>We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Use what you see, don't plan it. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.</p>
<h4>4 November 2018</h4>

<p>I once ate a whole shipping crate of carrots in a whole day and I could feel my vision strengthen. At first I thought I was just full from the carrots, but my skin started to turn orange. I didn't know what was happening but I had an uncontrollable urge to eat more carrots. I drove into the nearest farmers market and literally ripped the tarps off the old ladies stand for some carrots.</p>
