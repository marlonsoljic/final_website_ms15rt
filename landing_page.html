<p>Assignments are due today, dont forget! Here is some classic Lorem Ipsum. Nullam malesuada sodales dapibus. Phasellus velit neque, auctor a diam commodo, placerat sodales lacus. Praesent ante quam,
ullamcorper in mi quis, luctus ullamcorper ante. Nunc mollis libero in venenatis aliquet. Donec congue lorem et risus fringilla, id porta lacus lacinia. Fusce id dictum lorem. Nam magna
ex, pellentesque sit amet ultrices quis, ultrices ac felis. Aenean volutpat facilisis quam quis suscipit. Curabitur nec aliquet nunc. Aliquam blandit enim non blandit scelerisque. Praesent eu

 <p>I once drank a whole gallon of milk in a whole day and I could feel my bones expand. At first I thought I was just full from the milk, but my skin started to form stretch marks and I was visibly wider. I didn't know what was happening but I had an uncontrollable urge to drink more milk. I drove into the nearest gas station and literally ripped the door off the rifrigerated section containing the milk.</p>

 <p>What the jiminy crickets did you just flaming say about me, you little bozo? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Cub Scouts, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret camping trips in Wyoming, and I have over 300 confirmed knots. I am trained in first aid and I’m the top bandager in the entire US Boy Scouts (of America). You are nothing to me but just another friendly face</p>
